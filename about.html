            <h2>Jeremiah Marrujo</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Governors University, where I'm honing my skills in software development, cloud computing, and data structures. With a passion for creating and a love for continuous learning, I'm dedicated to building innovative solutions that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background includes experience in software development, where I've worked on projects ranging from web development to game programming. I am particularly interested in leveraging my skills to develop user-friendly applications and systems that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working on several personal projects to expand my portfolio, including a rocket launch simulation game, a golf swing measurement tool, and a mind-reading game. Each project allows me to apply and refine my programming skills in Java, Python, and other technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to complete my degree and transition into a full-time software engineering role, where I can continue to grow and contribute to meaningful projects. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting, working with a team to develop innovative software solutions.
