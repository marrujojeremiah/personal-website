        <h2>Mind Reader</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Mind Reader is an interactive game where the application attempts to predict the number the user is thinking of through a series of questions. The project involves basic algorithmic logic and decision trees to narrow down the possible choices and eventually guess the correct number.</p>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Incorporating more advanced algorithms to improve prediction accuracy, adding a learning feature where the application adjusts based on previous games, and integrating voice recognition to make the game more interactive.</p>
